article1
a healthy sea
It is not only a home for more than 700,000 species of living things, but is also essential for the survival of the entire planet. The oceans that provide jobs and food for billions of people are critical to human health and well-being.

But now the sea is in greater danger than ever. Pollution from various toxic substances such as plastics, destructive fishing, and climate change are intensifying, putting the marine ecosystem under serious threat. However, if we work together, we will be able to save the sea and protect the many marine creatures and people who live in the sea.

article2
The use of fossil fuels is accelerating climate change and ocean acidification, putting the oceans at risk. Destructive fishing is destroying marine habitats and putting millions of species at risk of extinction. Scientists say the extinction of marine life in the next century could be the worst extinction since the age of the dinosaurs. But we can stop this crisis. If we act together, we can save the sea and the living things that live in it from crisis and protect the green planet.
